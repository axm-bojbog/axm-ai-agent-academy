## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è CODENAME: `OPERATION DEPLOYMENT READY`

> **‚è±Ô∏è Operation Time Window:** `~30 minutes`  

## üéØ Mission Brief

Welcome to the first mission of your training as a Copilot Studio Agent.  
Before you can start building your first AI agent, you need to establish your **field-ready development environment**.

This briefing outlines the systems, access credentials, and setup steps required to successfully operate in the Microsoft 365 ecosystem.

## üîé Objectives

Your mission includes:

1. Loging into a developer environment as your Copilot Studio environment to build in  
1. Creating a SharePoint site to serve as your data source in later missions

---

## Step 1: Login into the development environment

Copilot Studio resides within Microsoft 365, so you need a Microsoft 365 account to access it. You can use the existing account you have been provided as an intern, e.g. intern@axm365.com/intern@axaptamasters.com.
 
1. Go to the [Microsoft Copilot Studio](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com/)
2. Login with your Microsoft 365 account.
3. Once the platform is opened, change the environment to **AXM AI Playground**, this will be the environment where you will do your lab exercises and implement your project.

> **Note:** You should only use the environment **AXM AI Playground**, do not use the default environment **Axapta Masters (default)** or any other environment (if you have access to).

## Step 2: Check access to the SharePoint site

A SharePoint site is created  which will be used in [Lesson 06 - Create a custom agent using the conversational creation experience with Copilot and grounding it with your data](/06-create-agent-from-conversation/README.md/#62-add-an-internal-knowledge-source-using-a-sharepoint-site).

1. Go to the [ContosoIT SharePoint site](https://axmasters.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/ContosoIT2/SitePages/ITHelpdeskHome.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=zno0s5) and login with your intern account. You should be able to see the home page of the site.

2. Go to the **Devices** tab and check if you can see any data.

If you face any issues with access or cannot see any data on the site, please contact your dedicated Mentor!

You're officially cleared to begin your **Intern-level agent training** in [Lesson 01](../01-introduction-to-agents/README.md).
